bookwyrm is a TUI-based program written in C++17 which, given some input
data, searches for matching ebooks and academic papers on various sources.
During runtime, all found items are presented in a menu, where
you can choose which items you want to download.

An item can be viewed for details, which will be fetched from some
database (unless the source itself holds enough data), such as the Open
Library or WorldCat. A screen holding logs from worker threads is
available by pressing TAB. All unread logs are printed to std{out,err}
upon program termination.

For example, one might run bookwyrm as follows:

    bookwyrm --author "Naomi Novik" --serie Temeraire --year >=2015

Sources are written as scripts which run in their own worker threads.
Some scripts are available upstream, but you can also write your
own into `~/.config/bookwyrm/sources/`. Currently, only Python
scripts are supported, but LUA is being considered. A script may need
data from the user (e.g. login credentials); this can be written into
`~/.config/bookwyrm/config.yaml`.

Aside from a C++17-compliant compiler and CMake, bookwyrm also depends
on a few libraries:
    - fmt,        for a few print-outs and since spdlog depends on it;
    - spdlog,     for logging warnings/errors/etc. to the user;
    * termbox,    for the TUI;
    * pybind11,   for interfacing with Python, and
    * fuzzywuzzy, for fuzzily matching found items with what's wanted.

All libraries enumerated with a hyphen '-' are non-essential and may
be subject to removal later in development.

bookwyrm is still in the early development stage, so nothing is set in
stone. A v1.0.0 release is planned for eartly Q1 2018.
