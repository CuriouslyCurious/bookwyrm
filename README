bookwyrm is a TUI-based program written in C++17 which, given some input
data, searches for matching ebooks and academic papers on various sources.
When done, all found items are presenting in a mutt-like index menu, where
you choose which items you want to download.

An item can be viewed for details, which will be fetched from some
database, such as the Open Library or WorldCat.

For example, one might run bookwyrm as follows:

    bookwyrm --author "Naomi Novik" --serie Temeraire --year >=2015


Sources are written as scripts run asynchronously during run-time.
Some scripts are available upstream, but you can also write your
own into `~/.config/bookwyrm/sources/`. Currently, only Python
scripts are supported, but LUA is being considered.

Aside from a C++17-compliant compiler and CMake, bookwyrm also depends
on a few libraries:
    - fmt,        for a few print-outs and since spdlog depends on it;
    - spdlog,     for warning/error reports to the user;
    * pybind11,   for interfacing with Python, and
    * fuzzywuzzy, for fuzzily matching found items with what's wanted.

All libraries enumerated with a hyphen '-' are non-essential and may
be subject to removal later in development.

bookwyrm is still in the early development stage, so nothing is set in
stone. If you have any insights, questions, or wish to contribute,
