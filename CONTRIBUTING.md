You are welcome to contribute, be it code, bug reports, or feature requests.

If you do not know where to start, I've made sure to stringle some `TODO: ...`s through-out the code base.
These comments denote stuff that ~~needs~~ should be done, but don't deserve their own issues.
To find these code blocks, just
```sh
$ cd $(git rev-parse --show-toplevel) # move to project root
$ grep -rn "TODO" src include
```
