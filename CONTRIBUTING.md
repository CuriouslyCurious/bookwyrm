Contributing
---
You are welcome to contribute, be it code, bug reports, or feature requests.

Considering the still rather undefined direction of this project,
please contact me or start a discussion issue if you're planning some contribution which isn't already documented in the existing issues
(if you want your contribution merged, that is).

If you do not know where to start, I've made sure to stringle some `TODO: ...`s through-out the code base.
These comments denote stuff that ~~needs~~ should be done, but don't deserve their own issues.
To find these code blocks, just
```sh
$ cd $(git rev-parse --show-toplevel) # move to project root
$ grep -rn "TODO" src include
```
