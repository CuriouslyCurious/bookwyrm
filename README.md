## What is this?
The town's local bookwyrm has a vast library
ranging from old classical screen-plays to freshly-minted academia.
Without her help, retrieving one of these items may get tricky, or nigh impossible.
Where would you look to get that one paper you really need to read?
Where would you search for that one book you really want?
Where can you get your hands on newly released digital page-turners
that aren't bogged down DRM to the point you need Abobe's permissions to read its content?

Your Journey to Find the Thing may fear you, but fret not,
`bookwyrm` will do the dirty work for you.
Just give her a DOI, ISBN, title, URL or other entity used to identify books or papers
and she'll fetch it for you - be it a childrens' adventure book or the Necronomicon.
No due time, guaranteed!
